Simon
released 1978 under the name "Follow Me"
it was a basic memory game made in response to the percieved poor presentation of the Atari at a trade show in 1976

this version of simon plays like normal, except that you have to press the start button to start the game, and each subsequent level

for future improvements I'd like to add sounds to the buttons and win/ loss screens, as well as make it scale down for mobile screens properly
